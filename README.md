# Hi there 👋

🎓 I’m a Computer Science student at BUPT.  
💻 I’m currently working on several full-stack and data-driven projects including **HPQAQ**, **DSL-Agent**, and **Campus Navigation System**.  
🌱 I’m learning advanced Python development, C++ system programming, algorithms, and Git/GitHub DevOps workflows.  
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **backend development**, **data analysis**, **LLM-based tools**, and **CS education projects**.  
🧠 I’m interested in distributed systems, networking, and AI-assisted automation.  
🎷 Fun fact: I play the alto/soprano curved saxophone and enjoy jazz improvisation.  
💬 Ask me about Python, Flask, Vue3, Git workflows, C++, network labs, or saxophone gear 🎷
